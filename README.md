## Our build steps collection

We maintain a [library of Bitrise build steps](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib), featuring all the [integrations](https://www.bitrise.io/integrations) we deploy to [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

### Steps

A step is a script with a corresponding `yml` that conforms to the formatting and naming conventions of the StepLib.

You can find all our steps' `yml`s under [/steps](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise-steplib/tree/master/steps).

The repositories of steps which we maintain and support can be queried by searching for [steps-](https://github.com/bitrise-io?utf8=%E2%9C%93&query=steps-) on our [GitHub page](https://github.com/bitrise-io).

### Scripts

We have most of our scripts written in Go and bash, but it's possible to write it in any language our machines have installed like Ruby or Node.js.

> You can create a StepLib independently from Bitrise anytime, you will be able to use our CLI tools to maintain it, they are not tied to *our StepLib*.

## Bitrise CLI tools

Check out our [CLI's page](https://www.bitrise.io/cli) for a nice intro about why is it helpful to have Bitrise installed on your machine.

### Bitrise

[The runner itself](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise), you can install it to your machine with Homebrew:

`brew update && brew install bitrise`

Or `curl` down the latest version with the help of our guide on the [releases page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise/releases).

### envman

[`envman`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/envman) is our handy environment variable manager for switching between environment sets quick & easy.

### stepman

[`stepman`](https://github.com/bitrise-io/stepman) is our solution to manage decentralized StepLib step (script) collections.

You will run into `stepman` directly most probably when you are sharing your own step to a StepLib.

>We have a collection of useful tools under the [bitrise-tools](https://github.com/bitrise-tools) account. Not all of them part of the Bitrise CLI family, but are connected to our technology.

All Bitrise CLI tools are written in Go.

## Stack

### OS X

We are working with [vSphere](https://www.vmware.com/products/vsphere), [Ansible](http://docs.ansible.com/) and [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/) to virtualize, bootstrap and fire up the OS X build machines for builds on [bitrise.io](https://www.bitrise.io).

You can find all of our bootstrap scripts on the [OS X bootstrap GitHub page](https://github.com/bitrise-io/osx-box-bootstrap).

### Docker

We have a [base image](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/bitrise-base) and an [Android version](https://github.com/bitrise-docker/android) with pre-installed tools for Android builds.

>When a new version of a stack is available there will be a system report generated under the [system_reports](https://github.com/bitrise-io/bitrise.io/blob/master/system_reports) folder of this repository.
